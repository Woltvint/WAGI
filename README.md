WAGI is a hobby project focused on creating an AutoGPT web app.
The project is in early development and is being worked on in leftover time, so I am sorry in advance for the code quality :)
[Demo](https://wagi.woltvint.net)

## Features

- a web app for monitoring the agent
- chatGPT based agent
- chatGPT-powered long-term memory system (with a graph to display it)
- limited web search using duckduckgo
- stopping when a goal is reached
- a code window the AI can write into

## Planned Features

- access to websites with an URL
- gpt-4 support
- state export & import (or saving to web storage)
- spawning sub-agents to perform other tasks
- shell commands using ssh
- custom commands written by the AI itself for itself at runtime
- user input (or prompts from the AI for the user)
- simulated file system 
- full agent input customization in the UI


## Demo

A demo of this app is available [here](https://wagi.woltvint.net) 

to use it you just have to enter the OpenAI API key in the settings, edit the goal, and press the play button
